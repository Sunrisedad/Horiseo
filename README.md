# Horiseon Marketing Solutions Refactor

## This is the first challenge

## The goal is to refactor the website for better viewability/accessiblity

## User Story:

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria for challenge:

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## I added the following changes:

- I updated the title to reflect the website better
- Added semantic tags: header, nav, section, article, aside, footer
- Changed h3 tags to h2 tags in aside to fix importance and restyled to make the font smaller
- Added alt text for images
- CSS selectors and properties were consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure
- Matched structure of CSS to HTML 
- Fixed missing id tag to make menu link work 
- Added comments for HTML/CSS for better readability
